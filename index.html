  <h1><strong>Tom and Jerry</strong></h1>
  <br>
  <p><em>Tom and Jerry is an American animated franchise and series of comedy
      short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.
      The series centers on a friendship/rivalry (a love-hate relationship)
      between the title characters Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse.
      In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts
      for MGM from 1940 to 1958.[1] During this time, they won seven Academy
      Awards for Animated Short Film.number of spin-offs have been made, including
      the television series The Tom and Jerry Show (1975), The Tom and Jerry
      Comedy Show (1980–1982), Tom & Jerry Kids (1990–1993), Tom and Jerry Tales
      (2006–2008), and The Tom and Jerry Show (2014–present).The first
      feature-length film based on the series, Tom and Jerry: The Movie,
      was released in 1992, and 13 direct-to-video films have been produced
      since 2002, with an upcoming animated/live-action hybrid film to be
      released in 2020.</em></p>

  <h3><strong>Tom and Jerry</strong></h3>
  <p><em>Tom (named "Jasper" in his debut appearance) is a grey and white
      mute domestic shorthair cat. ("Tom" is a generic name for a male cat.)
      He is usually but not always, portrayed as living a comfortable,
      or even pampered life, while Jerry (named "Jinx" in his debut
      appearance) is a small, brown mute, house mouse who always
      lives in close proximity to Tom.Despite being very energetic,
      determined and much larger, Tom is no match for Jerry's wits.
      Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size,
      approximately the equivalent of Tom's, lifting items such as
      anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts
      . Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite
      rare for Tom to actually try to eat Jerry, but only to hurt
      or compete with him as usual in a more intimidating strategy
      to just taunt Jerry (even as revenge), and even to obtain a
      reward from a human (including his owner(s)/master(s))
      for catching Jerry, or for generally doing his job greatly
      as a house cat. By the final "fade-out" of each cartoon,
      Jerry usually gets the best of Tom.</em></p>

  <h3><strong>Spike and Tyke</strong></h3>
  <p class="spikeandtyke"><em>In his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often has to deal
      with Spike (known as "Killer" and "Butch" in some shorts),
      an angry, vicious but easily duped bulldog who tries to
      attack Tom for bothering him or his son Tyke while trying
      to get Jerry. Originally, Spike was unnamed and mute
      (aside from howls and biting noises) as well as attacking
      indiscriminately, not caring whether it was Tom or Jerry
      though usually attacking Tom. In later cartoons, Spike
      spoke often, using a voice and expressions</em></p>

  <h3><strong>Butch and Toodles Galore</strong></h3>
  <p><em>Butch is a black, cigar-smoking alley cat who also wants to eat
      Jerry. He is Tom's most frequent adversary. However, for most of
      the shorts he appears in, he is usually seen rivaling Tom over
      Toodles. Butch was also Tom's chum as in some cartoons, where Butch
      is leader of Tom's alley cat buddies, who are mostly Lightning,
      Topsy, and Meathead. Butch talks more often than Tom or Jerry
      in most shorts.</em></p>
